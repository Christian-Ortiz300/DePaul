    <h3> Q1.What is an HTML "comment"? why is commenting important when writing code?</h3>
    
    <p></p> an HTML comment is a tag where you add comments in regards to your HTML source. It looks like this: &lt; !---- &gt;. 
    HTML comments helps with communicating with either yourself and with others. It can often remind someone to do something or can help 
    communicate with another person who is looking at their code.

    <h3> Q2.Many tags and attributes have been "deprecated" over the years. Included among these are the &lt;font&gt; tag (for changing the font), 
        the &lt;u&gt; tag (for underlying), and the &lt;center&gt; tag for centering text. Why have these tags been deprecated?
    </h3>

    <p>The reason is because one can use CSS to "style" it. therefore theres no need of it to be changed within the HTML file when it can be done in CSS.
        Therefore, it has led them to be phased out of the HTML standard.
