<!-- 2-3 reasons why we should use semantic tags -- 
    1) it helps organize your html file and therefore makes it clear for someone who is looking at it. 
    2) The search engine often uses the tags to determine how to display your webpage. 
    3) it is best practice since most if not all companies use semantic tags to code their webpages.
